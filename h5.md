## Jos Helmich - Industrial Cyber Security
Jos told about himself and his work experience. He also told about ENISA and his work there.
Main topics in his presentation were 
- RED (Radio equipment directive) 
- NIS2 (EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity directive)
- CER (Critical Entities Resilience Directive)
- ISO27001 (Standard for information security management systems).
He explained what those mean and when they are valid.

Powerpoint slides were good and also the presentation itself. 
Afterwards I tried to find Powerpoint and recording from HelSec but I didn't find. 
In general these kind of directives and standards are good. Those help companies to take care of information security in appropriate level and customers can evaluate companies using these directives and standards.

## Heikki ”zokol” Juva - State of Union
Heikki told how they tested 10 devices according 3 categorization but I remember accurately only 1 categorization. It related personal data.
The device he used as example didn't pass the test. If I remember right the device was good only in updating itself automatically.
Test considered GDPR in physical and in cloud level. TLS(3) was used in device and it was good. And device wasn't online all the time which makes hacking the device harder.

It was very interesting to listen to this presentation. These kind of tests should be done more and tested devices should get some kind of certificate. This would help consumers to buy safer devices.

## Flash talks
Young man told how he has participated International CyberSecurity Challenge and what their team did there. It was very nice to see how eager and proud he was. We would need these kind of young people more!
