"2.3 One-way Fuctions"
- One-way functions are easy to compute but difficult to reverse.
- Strictly mathematically it might be so that one-way functions don't exist at all
- Can't be used for encryption as is because no one can't decrypt it
- Trapdoor one-way function has secret trapdoor. It is easy to compute in one direction and hard to compute it in to other direction. Having secret enables you to compute to other direction easily. 

2.4 One-Way Hash Functions
- One-way hash function has many names and it is central for modern cryptography.
- Function takes a variable-lenght input string (pre-image) and converts it to fixed-lenght (generally smaller) output string (hash value).
- The point is to fingerpirnt the pre-image
- Can be used to get a reasonable assurance of accuracy
- A good one-way hash function is collision-free. It is hard to generate two pre-images with the same hash value.
- A hash function is public
- A message authentication code (MAC) also know as a data authentication code (DAC), is a one-way hash funtion with addition of a secret key.

Karvinen 2022: Cracking Passwords with Hashcat

https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/

- Systems don't store original passwords,they store hashes. It is one-way function, which can't be turned back.
- When doing penetration testing take care of legal and ethical considerations.
- Task/questions
	- Install Hashcat
	- Identify Hash Type
	- Crack the Hash
	- What did Hachcat say?
	- Where did the solution go?
	- Can I make it go faste?
	- What next?

Voluntary bonus article (but recommended if you're not familiar with Linux command line): Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited

https://terokarvinen.com/2020/command-line-basics-revisited/

- Basic command line commands for Linux and BSD listed

a) Billion dollar busywork. Command 'echo -n "hello"|sha256sum' prints a hash. Try adding something to the string, e.g. 'echo -n 'hello asdf'|sha256sum'. 
What do you have to add to get a hash that starts with a zero? 
- Tested adding letters and numbers but I wasn't able to generate a hash which would start by 0.
  
(Voluntary bonus: How is this related to Bitcoin? Voluntary difficult bonus: How many zeros can you get to the beginning? Voluntary difficult bonus: How does the difficulty raise?)

b) Compare hash. Create a small text file. Take it's hash (e.g. 'sha256sum tero.txt'). Change one letter. Take the hash again. Compare hashes. What do you notice?
-good.txt file crated
-sha256 generated
-letter changed inside the file and sha256 taken again
-I notice that there are not any similarity on hashes

c) Hashcat. Install hashcat and test that it works.
Installed according instructed on https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashc

d) Dictionary attack. Crack this hash: 21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3
- Result is: lollollol -> johny

e) How can you make a password that's protected against a dictionary attack?
- password should be something unic, not the common ones
- use special marks between letter
- don't user clear words
- password should have small and capital letter, special marks and numbers

j) John. Install Jumbo John (John the Ripper, open source Jumbo version). 
Compile it from source code as needed. See Karvinen 2023 Crack File Password With John.
