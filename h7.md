x) Read and summarize (briefly, e.g. with some bullets) Infosec review article.

First I installed Google Scholar. And then I Googled articles which were related to information security of StarLink / satellite, using years 2022-2024, language English.
But JUFO https://jfp.csc.fi/jufoportal?lang=fi didn't find name of journals or ISSN mentioned on articles.
So finally I decided to write 'security' to JUFO searching tool and seleced article in that way.

I picked Journal of Cyber Security Technology, JUFO rating 1.
Journal of Cybersecurity, 2022 - academic.oup.com

Article published 5th of Feb 2024

Summare is based on skimming.

## Cyber diplomacy: defining the opportunities for cybersecurity and risks from Artificial Intelligence, IoT, Blockchains, and Quantum Computing

- Cyber diplomacy is critical in dealing with the digital era’s evolving cybersecurity dangers and possibilities. Cyber diplomacy can promote cybersecurity, protect national interests, and foster mutual trust among nations in the digital sphere by capitalising on possibilities and reducing threats.
- Cyber Diplomacy is a term used to describe the application of diplomatic techniques and negotiations in international relations that deal with and regulate cyberspace-related issues.
- Cyber Diplomacy is usually applied to managing the difficulties and obstacles presented by the cyber world and aims to promote responsible actions, preserve cybersecurity, and ensure stability in cyberspace. Without cyber diplomacy in developing national cybersecurity policies, adversaries can apply complex social engineering tactics and present advanced persistent threats and even political threats for national cybersecurity environments.

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a pivotal element in cyber diplomacy, influencing various aspects, from threat detection to international negotiations. AI’s ability to analyse vast datasets rapidly is instrumental in identifying potential cyber threats, aiding diplomatic efforts in cybersecurity. 
- The proliferation of IoT devices has significant implications for cyber diplomacy. IoT devices contribute to an interconnected global network, raising concerns about cross-border data flows and international standards for device security. 
- Blockchain technology introduces a novel secure data sharing and verification paradigm for cyber diplomacy. The immutability and transparency of blockchain can enhance trust in international agreements and shared documents. But there are also Blockchain related challenges.
- Quantum computing presents both an opportunity and a challenge for cyber diplomacy. Its potential to break conventional encryption poses a significant threat to national security, requiring international cooperation to develop quantum-resistant cryptographic standards

- Cyber diplomacy is critical in dealing with the complexity of the digital environment in international relations. It encourages responsible behaviour, safeguards cybersecurity, and assures cyberspace stability. All important components are international cooperation, conflict resolution, cybersecurity governance, confidence-building measures, attribution, public-private partnerships, capacity building, and defending digital rights and freedoms. As the internet connects the world, international collaboration in cyberspace is critical for detecting, preventing, and responding to cyber threats. Data moves across borders, prompting joint efforts to solve internet governance issues and develop data protection and privacy standards.
- Non-state actors are also important in cyber international relations. Private firms and corporations support cyber diplomacy by forming public-private partnerships, exchanging threat intelligence, and partnering with governments to improve cybersecurity and protect key infrastructure. Academic institutions, advocacy groups, and cybersecurity communities are all examples of civil society organisations that play an important role in cyber diplomacy. They promote awareness, share knowledge, and campaign to protect digital liberties and rights. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and think tanks contribute to cyber diplomacy talks through research, expert analysis, and policy suggestions, working with governments and international organisations.
- Despite its great potential, cyber diplomacy is limited in many ways, which may restrict its effectiveness. Traditional diplomatic methods are being challenged by the quick speed of technical breakthroughs and the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats. Furthermore, in the cyber arena, the issue of trust and suspicion among states can stymie genuine collaboration and information sharing. Attributing the origin of cyber-attacks complicates diplomatic operations even more, and the inclusivity of cyber diplomacy may be limited, potentially omitting vital perspectives from non-state player.
