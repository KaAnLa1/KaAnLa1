Nakamoto 2008: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (A colored HTML version), chapters
https://git.dhimmel.com/bitcoin-whitepaper/

1 Introduction
- Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. 
- What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.

2 Transactions
- Electronic coin is defined as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership. 
- There is a need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions.

3 Timestamp Server
- Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.

4 Proof-of-Work
- The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits.
- For this timestamp network, they implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that gives the block’s hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks after it.
- The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.

5 Network

The steps to run the network are as follows:

1. New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
2. Each node collects new transactions into a block.
3. Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
4. When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
5. Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
6. Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.

6 Incentive
- By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block
- The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.
- The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest.

7 Reclaiming Disk Space
- Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. 

8. Simplified Payment Verification
- It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he’s convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it’s timestamped in.
- As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker’s fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user’s software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency.

9. Combining and Splitting Value
- To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs

10. Privacy
- Privacy can be maintained by breaking the flow of information in place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.
- As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.

11. Calculations
- If considered scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent.
- The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk.

a) Wallet. Create a BitCoin testnet wallet. (For example, electrum)
- sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install electrum; electrum --testnet  from memory
- Electrum installed using default settings.

b) Faucet. Get worthless fake money from a testnet Bitcoin faucet.
- https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/
  	- Tested to send bitcoins but my Master Public Key is red on page and clicking "Get bitcoins!" doesn't do anythin.
- https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/
  	- I used my Master Public Key and sum I used was 0.00001. Veryfiening took long time so I clicked send bitcoin and received message: Bots are not allowed here.
- My Electrum Testnet tells on left lover corner: Not Connected. Wondering should I have had to open Channels even during installation I used default setting Auto connect.

c) Giveway. Move money to another Bitcoin wallet. Choose an amount where the last two digists are 73. // Can't do, I don't have any bitcoins
d) Recycle. Move the testnet money back to the same faucet you got it from. // Can't do, I don't have any bitcoins

e) Explorer. Use a block explorer to analyze a block on the real Bitcoin blockchain. Explain what each value and field means. You only need to analyze the block information and one sample transaction, as a block can contain many transactions. Voluntary bonus: Use a transaction that's interesting, such as one related to a crime or other unusual event.

- Height: Number of blocks percending in the blockchain.
- Status: Tells the status "In best chain (24 confirmations).
- Timestamp: gloval variable representing the current timestap of the block being mined.
- Size: the largest quantity of data that a singel block can accommodate in a blockchain.
- Virtual Size: the same as its weight divided by 4 https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/transaction/size/#vbytes
- Weight Units: Every transaction has a weight measurement. This measurement was introduced in the segregated witness upgrade. A transaction's weight is calculated by multiplying the size (in bytes) of different parts of the transaction by either 4 or 1:

f) RogeCoin. Critically comment on Honest Ads: If Cryptocurrency Was Honest (Video, about 5 minutes). Identify and list arguments made. Provide commentary to support and challenge each of the claims. If you can, provide references or real life examples to your claims. (This task does not require tests with a computer.)

- Needs lot of electricity is true.
- "Rogecoin retains it's value and normal money would loose it anytime." I think normal money as € or $ are more stable because those are widely used and have standardization.
- "Wallet is yours forever unless you give your money to scammer, someone hacks you, hard drive fails or you forget your wallet password." True
- RogeCoin is an investment which can trible the value or you can loose the value: True.
