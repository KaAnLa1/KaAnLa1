Chapter: 3 Design goals and assumptions

https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2022/readings/tor-design.pdf
- Tor seeks to frustrate attackers from linking communication partners, or from linking multiple communications to or from a single user.
- Other goals are deployability, usaability, flexibility and  simple desing
- Non-goals are not peer-to-peer, not secure against end-to-end-attacks, no protocol normalization, not treganographic
- Threat model assumes that in this low-latency anonymity systems that use layered encryption, the adversary’s typical goal is to observe both the initiator and the responder.

Abstract

- Anonymity networks are popular these days because users want to safequard their online privacy
- Anonymity is also missused
- There are attacks which assist in de-anonymising the TOR network  

I Introduction

- In response to de-anonymisation, pro-anonymity researchers attempted to strengthen users’ expected
anonymity by improving security and fixing known bugs. Also the growth of the Tor improved security.
  

II Background (to the end of "B. Circuit Establishent for Tor HS")

- Tor is an overlay network based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that builds circuits from
a user to the destination server, which generally consists of three voluntary relays.

- Components are 
	- Onion Proxy (OP) which is local software intalled on the user's device. It enables communication with the directory servers (DSs),
	establishes connections in the Tor network, and handles connections from the user’s applications.
	- Directory Servers (DS) are a small set of trusted and known servers in the network that actively keep details about the status of the complete network.
	- Entry Node/Guard is the relay in the Tor network that the client directly connects to, and hence, it knows the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the client.
	- Exit Node is the final hop of the Tor circuit. Therefore, it knows the IP address of the destination server accessed via the Tor network.
	- Hidden Services (HS) also known as Onion Services can be hosted on a node inside the Tor network or an external node. These
	have a top-level domain name ending in .onion. Hidden services are used to hide the identity of the website.
	- Introduction Points are random nodes selected Byt he HS to register its services with the Tor network. To avoid any impact from possible Denial of Service (DOS)attacks against a single introduction point.
	- Rendezvous Points (RPs) is a random Tor node selected by the client OP before the client initialises a connection with any of the introduction points advertised by the DS. The client selects two other nodes (entry and middle) and establishes a Tor circuit to the RP via these nodes. As a result, the RP does not know the identity of the client.
	- Bridges are normal Tor relays that are not listed publicly in the main Tor directory. They replace guard nodes in the circuit; however, only a few bridges are provided to each client. Therefore, no authority is able to obtain a complete list of bridge nodes.

Standard Tor circuit Establishment

Before communicating over the Tor network, a Tor client must establish a circuit through the Tor network. 
The user is required to have the Onion Proxy (OP) installed on the device being used for browsing. The OP first contacts a DS
and requests a list of active relays in the network. Then it selects three relays from the list to act as the entry, middle,
and exit nodes, and incrementally creates a circuit by exchanging encryption keys with each node, one hop at a time.

Circuit Establishment for TOR HS

The HS owner can advertise the service’s onion address using multiple platforms
(e.g., websites, blogs, other hidden services). If users want to access a HS, they need to find its onion address through these platforms.

Humoristic video advice that you should not use memory stick which you are not sure it is safe.


# a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR).

- Downloaded for Linucx from https://www.torproject.org/download/ Linux version
- Extracted. Took time to fing start-tor-browser.desktop
- Untrusted application launcher attention appeared, decided to take a risk because I have a test machine which I will format after course. So I clicked launch anyway.
- Clicked Connect with default settings


# b) Browse TOR network.

Find, take screenshots and comment

- search engine for onion sites
- human rights or civil rights organization
- marketplace
- fraud
- forum
- a well known organization (with regular postal addresses, offices or similar presence outside darknet)

Use .onion addresses inside TOR network, not regular (clearnet) websites trough exit nodes.

# c) Onion. In your own words, how does anonymity work in TOR? (e.g. how does it use: public keys, encryption, what algorithms? This subtask does not require tests with a computer.)

- The key exchange is done via the Diffie–Hellman handshake. Tor uses fixed-length cells of 512 bytes for communication
to make traffic analysis harder. 


# d) What kind of the threat models could TOR fit? (This subtask does not require tests with a computer.)

TOR could be used for threats which benefits from anonymity for example selling drugs.

# e) Don't stick that stick. How does PhishSticks attack work? Would a typical organization be vulnerable? Does this link to a broader category of attacks and defenses? How could the risk be mitigated? (This subtask does not require tests with a computer.) (If you want, you can view PhishSticks on Github and PhishSticks Youtube channel.

- PhisStick attack work in the way that user of the computer has to plug the stick to computer. 
And stick has malicious software which is installed without any help of user. Typical organizations are very vulnerable for this kind of threats. PhisSticks can be used for a broader attacks and defenses. Risk could be mitigated by training users not to plug anything to workstations if they are not 100 % sure it is safe and also in some cases disabling usb ports.
